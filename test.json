    "TranslatedText": "September 11 Tragedy Exposed Fragility \nof the internet and helped the web to mature\nService had slow problems when social networks didn't exist yet\n\nAndré Sartorelli, from R7\n\n\nadvertising\nWhen information about the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center towers began circulating around the world on September 11, 2001, in the United States, many people immediately turned on the nearest TV and were able to watch the terrible outcome marked by the deaths of nearly 3,000 people.\n\nThrough the streets of Manhattan, lines formed in front of pay phones. Within a few minutes, the telephone system collapsed, also affecting the internet, a means of communication that worked mainly through dial-up connections.\n\nHow was your September 11, 2001?\n\nRemember the day the WTC fell\n\nSee attacks on 11 historical images\n\nIn Brazil, Embratel, at the time the main operator of long-distance calls, recorded, compared to an ordinary day, a forty-fold increase in the number of calls to the United States between 11:00 and 12:00. The total number of calls reached 1 million at that time - the average was 80 thousand. The situation was normalized only the next day.\n\nOn the day of the tragedy, internet traffic grew by around 20%. At the time, there were no social networks, which now facilitate interaction between people when something important happens. Mark Zuckerberg, who in 2004 founded Facebook, the largest social network in the world with more than 750 million users, was still in high school in 2001. Orkut and Twitter also only appeared in 2004.\n\nFor this reason, in the midst of chaos, email was the main resource for interaction through the web.\n\nBrazilian Flávia Leather, a credit analyst and resident of New Jersey since 1993, says she was working when she received the news about the attack.\n\n- Where I worked, many TVs were on all the time on financial business channels. Suddenly, the schedule was interrupted to show the WTC on fire. The cell phones weren't working. I was only able to contact my family using a landline and still had to try several times. The email worked smoothly and I was able to communicate with friends I have in Brazil.\n\nInternet searches\n\nThe University of Berkeley has set up a special website to help search for friends or family. The feature is practically the same as that adopted by Google shortly after the aftershocks that hit Chile in 2010 and the earthquake followed by the devastating tsunami faced by Japan in March this year.\n\nThe largest news portals in the world were facing their first global coverage since the beginning of the commercial internet in 1995. Choked by thousands of simultaneous hits, sites like CNN, the New York Times, Washington Post, El Pais, Le Monde and Brazilian portals adopted lighter covers, with few photos, because they knew that the speed of connections was very slow.\n\nOn September 11, 2001, internet access in Brazil grew by around 20% over the daily average. In journalistic websites, the increase was between 70% and 150% compared to the previous day, according to Embratel. \n\nFor Ramon Salaverria, a professor at the Faculty of Communication at the University of Navarra, Spain, the big event caused a renewal because, even with problems, the internet put to the test its ability to offer information in real time.\n\n- A netizen from São Paulo could follow online what communication outlets based in New York said. It was something that became customary afterwards. However, not all innovations were positive. 9/11 showed that digital media had a great technological fragility because many sites fell. Likewise, there was a lot of false information that spread over the internet absolutely quickly.\n\nConspiracy theories\n\nOn the same Tuesday that the attacks occurred, the first messages with alleged prophecies attributed to Nostradamus and passages from the Bible began to circulate on the net. Days later, even a step by step emerged to “identify” on a dollar bill the image of the two towers that hit the ground. The eBay shopping and sales site received advertisements that sold postcards and alleged pieces of the rubble of the Twin Towers.\n\nWith video production still very limited, e-mails with “mysterious” photographic montages spread around the world via email and blogs.\n\nOne of the greatest internet legends related to September 11, 2001 was Tourist Guy, a photo-montage in which a tourist appears who mysteriously would have been photographed at the top of one of the towers seconds before one of the planes under terrorist control hit the building. At the bottom of the assembly, you can see an aircraft approaching.\n\nRosana Hermann, journalist and blogger for R7",
